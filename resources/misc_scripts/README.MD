These are misc. scripts that were used to do different things (mostly in terms of the database).

dump_gw2.py was used to populate the sqlite database from the GW2 API. It's hacky, I don't recommend using it
for anything unless you know what it's doing and how to change it to get the values needed.

Eventually I'll include a script to update your database with needed things, but that's not for awhile.
