# Niftybot-Discord - Discord bot built on Discord.py

Basic useful feature list:

 * Eventually...

TODO(s):
 * Clean cogs
 * Documentation

This bot is always in progress, and knowing me, I'll refactor it numerous times.  As of now, this does not include a setup script to handle installing [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) if you do not already have it.

The bot will be constantly undergoing changes as I decide new little cogs to add.

* The included niftybot.db has the tables needed to function
* use the included requirements file to install any required dependencies (pip3 install requirements.txt)

Some things the bot ships with:

 * Server based configuration files
 * Require terms acceptance before allowing command usage
 * SQLite database that ships with GW2 tables for the GW2 api cog
 * Multiple pre-written cogs
 * Basic documentation inside each class
 * requirements.txt for PIP3 install
 * Allow bot admins per server who can configure plugins
 * Syntax replacement for common messages
 * and more!

TODO(s):
 * Code cleanup and class merging where applicable
 * Continuing documentation, both within the code and on the documentation site

The bot will be constantly undergoing changes as I decide new little cogs to add.
