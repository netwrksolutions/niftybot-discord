# Niftybot-Discord - Discord bot built on [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)  
  
  ### Click [here](https://xnifty.github.io/niftybot-discord/) for documentation

Some things the bot ships with:

 * Server based configuration files
 * Require terms acceptance before allowing command usage
 * SQLite database that ships with GW2 tables for the GW2 api cog
 * Multiple pre-written cogs
 * Basic documentation inside each class
 * requirements.txt for PIP3 install
 * Allow bot admins per server who can configure plugins
 * Syntax replacement for common messages
 * and more!

TODO(s):
 * Code cleanup and class merging where applicable
 * Continuing documentation, both within the code and on the documentation site

The bot will be constantly undergoing changes as I decide new little cogs to add.
