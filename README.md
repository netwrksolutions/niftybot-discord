# Niftybot-Discord - Discord bot built on Discord.py

Basic useful feature list:

 * Eventually...

TODO(s):
 * Clean cogs
 * Documentation

This bot is always in progress, and knowing me, I'll refactor it numerous times.  As of now, this does not include a setup script to handle installing [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) if you do not already have it.

The bot will be constantly undergoing changes as I decide new little cogs to add.

* The included niftybot.db has the tables needed to function
* use the included requirements file to install any required dependencies (pip3 install requirements.txt)
